# Pair Programming: Pipeline Execution on AWS

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll work with a partner to replicate the workflow covered in the [Pipeline Creation](https://github.com/flatiron-school/DS-Deloitte-07062022-Architecting-Pipelines-with-AWS/blob/main/Pipeline%20Creation.ipynb) and [Pipeline Execution](https://github.com/flatiron-school/DS-Deloitte-07062022-Architecting-Pipelines-with-AWS/blob/main/Pipeline%20Execution.ipynb) lectures!

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Generate a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in the form of a JSON pipeline definition
- Define a set of Pipeline parameters that can be used to parametrize a SageMaker Pipeline
- Execute steps that create a model from the model artifacts used in training
- Perform batch transformation based on the model that was created

**Note:** *The [solution branch](https://github.com/flatiron-school/DS-Deloitte-07062022-PairProgramming-PipelineExecution/tree/solution) provides a more detailed walkthrough of how to approach this exercise.*
